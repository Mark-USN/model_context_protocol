Actual lines that run down along your side. >> Well, yes, you do. >> No, I didn't. Well, how come? >> Well, you're so self-conscious about your body.

If you hadn't told me about them, I wouldn't even known they existed. >> You were the one who always said we had to be honest with each other. I meant honestly about the things you don't like about yourself, not honestly about the things I don't like. >> Well, I'm very sorry I upset you. >> Why didn't you tell me about your lines before we got married? >> I didn't have them then. >> They just came one day. >> Why didn't you tell me the day they came? >> You know, you're really something.

Just because you hate yourself, you have to pick on me, huh? Anyway, why bring up a small birthark anyway? >> Small? That thing's as big as a Santa Rosa plum. >> Well, so what? Nobody can see it. >> I can see it. I see it when you're going into the shower. I see it when you're changing your clothes. I see it through your fishnet underwear. What? What? What? >> Yeah. Well, at least I bring it out in the open where you can see it. Not like you and your lies. >> What are we doing? Two grown, mature people arguing about skin. Honey, we're not talking about what you and I really are, what we think, what we feel. We're arguing about something as superficial as skin. >> Oh, you're right, darling. I'm sorry. >> It's not like us. I know it isn't. >> I care about your skin. I care about what's inside of you. >> Do you? >> Of course, darling. That's what I love. >> I love you for that. And I feel the same way, Poopsie. >> Good, darling. Good night. >> Good night. >> Tomorrow. >> All right, honey. Honey, what's wrong? >> It's just a lousy little blonde.
